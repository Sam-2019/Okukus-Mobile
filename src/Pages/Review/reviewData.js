      "Urban Fantasy alien harem catgirls. Two races at war crash-landing on an alien world; one human man, two feline women, one injured, and one very smart puppy, loyal to the man who raised her. It's been done before, but rarely so well. Better, even when you know how it ends, it's good to come back to however many times you choose to revisit. Better yet, there's a sequel waiting after.",
